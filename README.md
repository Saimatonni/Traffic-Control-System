# Traffic-Control-System
The implementation of a microcontroller firmware for a road traffic controller system
The microcontroller firmware for the road traffic controller system, on
the other hand, implements a state machine to control the behavior of traffic
lights based on various inputs. It communicates with other components of
the system, such as sensors and displays, through a selected communication
protocol. The design and implementation of the firmware are discussed in
detail and the results of testing are presented.
